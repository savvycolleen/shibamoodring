## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was built using a web API. There is a text box in the HTML for the user to type in their emotion and click the "Get Shiba" button. The button triggers a click event to fetch data from the API, and the data (in this case, a picture) is placed in the DOM.

## Optimizations

Right now, the JavaScript is written as a click event. This could be optimized to listen on "enter." The click event also currently runs with no text entered in the text box. This could be added as a turnary in the Javascript. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project brought me a lot of joy, because who doesn't love looking at silly photos of shibas? I was able to practice click events, fetches, and retrieving/placing data from web APIs to the DOM. I also learned that creating silly sites is a fun bonding experience with users.
